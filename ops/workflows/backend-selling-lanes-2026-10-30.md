# Backend selling lanes — build spec (2026-10-30)

Status: SPEC. Written from Chris's voice note on 2026-10-30. Waiting on the four decisions at the bottom. No code is written yet. Order of work: spec, then back end (Sonnet), then screens last (Opus). Law: build-spec-then-backend-then-frontend.

## What Chris wants, in plain words

After someone fills out the survey, Fundhub keeps teaching them by email, text and push until they show up to the call. What they get depends on who they are. A person who says "500 credit score" gets repair and Capital Blueprint content. If the setter finds out they really have a 700, their content changes to match. If they reschedule, the content keeps going. Email, text and push never go out at the same time. The goal is a higher show rate, because many people arrive not knowing why credit has to be fixed before funding.

This is Jeremy Haynes' "Harvester + Hammer Them" system (`marketing/ads/backend-selling-system.md`) made to run for each person.

## What is already in the repo (looked up 2026-10-30)

- **BS-01** (`src/workflows/bs-01-precall-launcher.mjs`) is on and registered. It starts when a call is booked, runs a 3-day grid (days 1 to 3, six slots a day), and stops when the call is held. It splits only two ways, funding or repair, using the credit-pull result (`clients.outcome_tier`). That result arrives after the call, so before the call most people get the text only.
- **The email copy is not real.** All 32 BS-FUND and BS-REPAIR email entries in `fundhub-docs/sources/EMAIL-TEMPLATES-SOURCE-OF-TRUTH.md` are sample filler text. BS-REPAIR has 6 cells with no entry at all. The send gate refuses filler text. Net effect today: BS-01 sends one text (`SMS-BS01-02-PRECALL`) and no emails. `TODO.md:171` records that the 15 placeholder emails were turned off on 2026-10-09.
- **The survey** (`api/public/survey-submit.mjs`, `src/survey/cf-question-map.mjs`) saves: credit score band (500-579, 580-649, 650-699, 700-749, 750+, Not sure), funding target, planned use, what they want to change, has business, revenue or income, available capital. It is stored in `clients.custom_fields` and in `client_custom_fields`. It does not collect "has negatives".
- **The setter does not verify credit today.** Josh only confirms the time and asks 2 or 3 survey facts. No field, no event and no code stores a corrected score. The setter SOP says to keep setter notes separate and never change the submitted answers.
- **Reschedule and cancel already work.** `booking.rescheduled` and `booking.cancelled` cancel the running drip and a reschedule starts a fresh one (`s-04b-booking-reminders.mjs`, `bs-01`).
- **Send rules.** All sends go through `sendTemplated`, which only queues. A cron sweeper sends every 5 minutes. Texts are blocked from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. Arizona time. Email has no quiet hours. There is no cap per person per channel beyond a 30-minute text duplicate block.
- **Push is not a channel yet.** It only rides along with a real text or email. Only the pre-call text can trigger it, and only for people who installed the app and turned on `marketing_push_enabled` (nothing sets that today). Lock-screen words come from a fixed approved list in `src/push/payload.mjs`.
- **Content that exists.** `marketing/ads/POST-BOOKING-15.md` holds 30 short-video concepts (titles and talking points), not email or text copy.

## The build

### 1. The lane

Each person has one lane at a time. The lane is a label saved on the person. Lanes set by Chris on 2026-10-30 (decision 1, answered):

| Lane | Who | Content theme |
|---|---|---|
| Funding | score 700 and up | how funding works, lender matching, stacking, what approved means |
| Blueprint | score 620 and up (650 is better), OR $5,000 or more in cash | Capital Blueprint, the 13 optimization points, how funding order works |
| Repair and partners | under the Blueprint bar AND under $5,000 cash | the other ways to get funded: credit repair, credit partners, finding someone to do it with you. Teach, never "you will not get funded" |

Chris's words: Blueprint fits when they have $5K cash or more, or a 620 FICO, ideally 650. Below that and under 699, they look into repair, credit partners and funding with help. The tone is education, not a no.

How the survey answers map:

- Score comes from `cf_svy_self_reported_fico`. Cash comes from `cf_svy_available_capital` ("$5k - $25k", "$25k - $100k" and "$100k+" count as $5,000 or more).
- The survey band "580-649" cannot tell 610 from 640. On the survey alone it counts as under the bar, so "650-699" is the Blueprint band. A 580-649 person with $5,000 or more cash still goes to Blueprint.
- "Not sure" counts as under the bar until the setter verifies.
- The verified score from the setter uses the exact 620 line and replaces the survey band whenever one is saved (section 2). The verified value is stored next to the survey answer, never on top of it.

### 2. The setter's correction (new)

- New saved field: `verified_fico_band`, plus who recorded it and when. Lives with the other per-person facts.
- New event: `setter.verified`. It is added to `src/events/canonical.mjs`. It fires when a setter or Josh saves the verified band.
- When it fires, the lane is worked out again. If the lane changed, the unsent steps for the old lane are cancelled and the new lane's steps are scheduled. Steps already sent are never sent again.

### 3. The timeline

Two phases, one engine:

- **Before booking:** starts at `survey.submitted`. The person gets the frenzy while they decide to book.
- **After booking:** starts at `booking.created`. All times are counted back from the call time (`startTime`). A reschedule re-counts from the new time and keeps going. This covers Chris's "they have another 2 days before they book" case and the reschedule case.

Design: a plan table with one row per planned send (person, lane, channel, template key, due time, status). The planner writes the rows. A sweeper on the Netlify clock (every 5 minutes, same pattern as `s-nobook-chase`) sends whatever is due through `sendTemplated`. A reschedule or a lane change rewrites the unsent rows. Reason for the table over long Inngest sleeps: Chris said on 2026-10-20 to stop burning ingests, and the table lets staff see each person's whole plan.

Channel timing rule: no two channels for the same person within 4 hours of each other. Suggested rhythm for a day: email in the morning, text at midday, push in the evening. Final hours are set by Chris (decision 4).

### 4. Stops

The plan for a person stops when any of these happens: the call is held (`call.completed`), the booking is cancelled with no new booking, they opt out of that channel, they pay for a product, or the cap in decision 4 is reached. Quiet hours and opt-out stay enforced by the existing gate.

### 5. Channels

- **Email and text:** work through the existing send path.
- **Push:** needs three new things before it can be a real channel: a send entry point that is not tied to an email or text, new approved lock-screen lines, and people with the app installed. Build email and text first. Push is phase 2 (decision 3).

### 6. Content

- Every template needs a key per lane, such as `LANE-REPAIR-PRE-03-EMAIL`, and gets approved by the owner before it can send (`compliance_passed`). Nothing is sent from filler text.
- Pieces are: belief-breaking, proof and testimonials (real source only), how funding works, how credit works, process short clips, diagrams. Chris films the videos; screen recordings from inside Fundhub and webcam clips are fine.
- Shared pieces ("what the call is", "what to bring") are written once and used in every lane.
- First set: pick 15 from `POST-BOOKING-15.md`, split across lanes, plus new lane-specific pieces. I write the email and text copy from Chris's videos and notes. Copy follows the ad rules: certain words, no "might", no day counts, never "number".
- Retire the old filler `BS-FUND-*` and `BS-REPAIR-*` keys when the lane keys go live.

### 7. Heartbeat (required in the same change)

- Ping row for the new sweeper in `src/pulse/heartbeats.mjs` and the sorting in `src/pulse/tripwires.mjs`.
- Deep check in `src/pulse/coverage/gap-<lane>.mjs`: "Is every person who booked a call in the next 72 hours holding a next planned send?" Goes red when someone has none.
- Tests: one pass and one fail case per check. `npm run pulse:prove` must say OK.

### 8. Proof

Scratch database only (law: verify-scratch-only, no-test-data-on-production). Walk: survey with band 500, plan appears for Repair; save verified 700, plan switches and sent steps are not repeated; reschedule moves the times; call held stops the plan. Then, when copy is approved, a prove-phone run to the agent number only.

## Order of work

1. Chris answers the four decisions. (This session)
2. Back end, Sonnet: new field and event, plan table, planner, sweeper, stops, heartbeat. No screens.
3. Copy, Opus plans, Sonnet writes drafts: templates for Repair lane first, because that lane has the biggest gap.
4. Front end, Opus, last: a staff view of one person's lane and plan. Optional until the back end is proven.

## Decisions only Chris can make

1. ~~**Lane cut points.**~~ Answered 2026-10-30. See section 1.
2. **Who records the verified score.** A human setter button on the setter screen, or Josh's call? (Josh does not ask for credit today, so this adds a new question to his call.)
3. **Push.** Email and text first and push later, or hold the launch for push?
4. **Cap and rhythm.** How many days does the plan run before it stops on its own, and what hours do email, text and push go out?

## Leftovers found (not fixed here)

- The code comment in BS-01 says 11 of 18 cells have copy. The docs show none do.
- `has_negatives` is not collected by the survey, so the PASS result in `classifySurvey` can never happen and every submit lands in MANUAL_REVIEW.
- Nothing sets `marketing_push_enabled`, so marketing push cannot reach anyone today.
