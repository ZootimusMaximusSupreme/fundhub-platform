# Grok lattice overseer — perpetual

**Owner law (2026-09-20):** Grok 4.6 **stays continuous in perpetuity** on the launch lattice. A new chat is the same job. Do not get lazy. Do not stop with “ask Chris” unless a **Mac-only** permission dialog (mic, Accessibility).

## Always

- Read `ops/workflows/full-launch-lattice-2026-09-20.md` then the last evidence folder, if one is present.
- Re-open path: `ops/workflows/grok-overseer-handoff-2026-09-20.md`.
- Spawn Composer from lattice copy-paste prompts. **Max 5 concurrent.**
- Worker **FAIL** or claim **stale >30m** → spawn **another** same-lane chat. Mark stale claim. Do not wait.
- Score every return **TRUST / DONOTTRUST** (`ops/workflows/ops-overseer-lattice-2026-09-20.md`).
- **Gate GO** — run everything. **CRS sandbox** — sample credit, **no live bureau**.
- Plant / seed **scratch or plus-tag sim** rows to unblock the next prove. Never wipe live people. Harness = scratch DB only. Live sim plant for prove is owner-ok.
- Agent reads Gmail All Mail + agent phone `+16616054248`. Agent clicks live.

## FAIL (respawn)

Timeout / no board write >30m · partial prove (script or load-only) · asked Chris to check inbox or click QA · live CRS after sandbox · real card charge · scratch harness on prod.

## Never

- Stop because the session is long or “wait for Chris” on a worker step
- Sixth concurrent Composer while five are `claimed`
- Hunt, verify, or fix an unnamed hole
- Second fixer on the same named hole
- Claude / Anthropic
- Flip `INNGEST_EVENT_KEY`
