# Marketing Command Center — what the back end does today

Required by `CLAUDE.md` §3a step 4. Written 2026-10-05 from the code on branch
`m10-dashboard-backend` (slice 1, back end only). The plan is
`docs/specs/marketing-dashboard-plan-2026-10-05.md`; the JSON shape is
`docs/specs/marketing-today-contract.md`.

Drawn from code, not from the plan. Anything the code does not do yet is marked
**NOT BUILT** rather than drawn as if it ran.

## The Today read — `GET /api/marketing/today`

Read only. Each part reads in its own short transaction (`asStaff()`), so one part
that cannot be read does not take the others with it.

```mermaid

  A[GET /api/marketing/today] --> B{signed in?}
  B -->|no| B1[401]
  B -->|yes| C{owner or admin?<br/>ROLE_SETS.MARKETING}
  C -->|no| C1[403, nothing read]
  C -->|yes| D[today = Arizona's day]
  D --> F[flywheel: marketing/flywheel/*<br/>evaluate + render from scripts/flywheel/status.mjs]
  D --> H[house partner fundhub-house]
  H -->|found| H1[copy: last 10 copy pieces + last 5 copy jobs]
  H -->|found| H2[copy_ready: switch, writer row, Anthropic key, budget]
  H -->|missing| H3[copy empty, copy_ready false, waiting: copy]
  D --> S[spend: today, last 7, prior 7, last 30<br/>from ad_metrics_daily, whole company]
  D --> L[last_sync: Meta connection + newest ad-day]
  F & H1 & H2 & S & L --> Z[200 with as_of and waiting]
  F -->|files not on server| W[that part null + named in waiting]
  S -->|table missing / no rows in 30 days| W
  L -->|table missing / never synced| W
  W --> Z
  D -->|database not answering| E[503 db down]
```

- A window with no saved ad-days is `null`, never `0`.
- A table or column that is not in the database yet (Postgres 42P01 / 42703 / 42883)
  makes that part `waiting`. Any other database error is a 503 (connection) or a 500.

## Write ad copy — the job states (existing Creative Factory path)

Nothing new in the states. What changed in slice 1: the writer's backup to Anthropic,
the copy writer row, and the house partner's switch (`db/seed/296`).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  C0[POST creative/generate<br/>asset_kind=copy, house partner] --> G{marketing switch on?}
  G -->|no| G1[403 suite_off, nothing saved]
  G -->|yes| C1[generation_jobs: queued]
  C1 -->|POST creative/run, or the runner every 2 min| C2[running]
  C2 --> R{copy writer row?}
  R -->|no| C9[failed: no active provider]
  R -->|yes| M[OpenAI first]
  M -->|answers| T[words]
  M -->|says no credit| A[Anthropic once,<br/>OpenAI key left out of that call]
  M -->|any other failure| X[error]
  A -->|answers| T
  A -->|fails| X
  X -->|tries left| C1
  X -->|no tries left| C9b[failed, with the reason]
  T --> C3[creative_assets kind=copy<br/>compliance: pending]
  C3 -->|screen finds nothing| C4[passed]
  C3 -->|a rule fires| C5[blocked, reasons kept]
  C4 -->|a person approves| C6[approved]
```

## NOT BUILT (on this branch)

- The page `public/app/marketing-command-center.*` (workflow M11).
- Running a flywheel stage from the page (slice 2). The flywheel rows are read only.
- The offer generator (workflow M12).

## U04 Jobs, buzzes, model cost and shoots — the records (migration 411)

Drawn 2026-10-05 from the code on branch `mm-u04-jobs-buzzes-usage`:
`src/marketing/jobs.mjs`, `src/marketing/job-kinds.mjs`, `src/marketing/notify.mjs`,
`src/marketing/model-usage.mjs`, `db/migrations/411_marketing_buzzes_usage_shoots.sql`.
These are libraries and tables only. **No route, clock or worker calls them yet**: the
worker that claims jobs and sends buzzes is U22, the Retry button's route is U26, the
writer that logs model cost is U24. Those calls are marked UNVERIFIED below.

### A queued job (marketing_jobs, table from 409; claim index from 411)

`attempts` counts runs that went wrong (a failure, or a claim nobody finished). Claiming
and requeueing do not count. Kind `offer` is never touched by any of this: it runs on the
Write offer path above (`src/marketing/offer-store.mjs`).

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> queued: enqueueJob (refuses kind 'offer')
  queued --> running: claimJobs — one statement, FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED, due now, never 'offer'
  running --> done: finishJob(result) — saves an empty result when the handler returned nothing
  running --> queued: requeueJob(runAfter) — wait loop, attempts unchanged
  running --> queued: failJob, 1st or 2nd time — attempts+1, run_after +1 min then +5 min, reason kept
  running --> failed: failJob 3rd time — "Tried 3 times and it still failed. Last error: …"
  running --> failed: failJob with final true — reason as given (e.g. cost cap reached)
  running --> queued: reclaimStale — claim older than 16 min, attempts+1
  running --> failed: reclaimStale 3rd time — "The worker stopped without finishing 3 times …"
  failed --> queued: retryJob — same company only, kind in the list passed, attempts 0, error and result cleared, due now
```

- `nextRunAfter({kinds})` reads the earliest queued `run_after` (never `offer`), so the
  worker can wait inside its pass for a job due in a few seconds. UNVERIFIED: no worker yet (U22).
- `JOB_KINDS` (`src/marketing/job-kinds.mjs`) is **empty**. A kind not in it is never
  claimed by the worker and cannot be retried from the screen. U24, U28 and U35 add kinds.
- Retry button → `POST marketing/jobs/retry` → `retryJob`: UNVERIFIED, the route is U26.

### A buzz (marketing_buzzes, 411)

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> waiting: queueBuzz — send_after = now, or 07:00 Arizona when inside quiet hours (one waiting per company + kind + group; a repeat refreshes the words)
  waiting --> sending: sendDueBuzzes — due, none of that kind sent in 10 min, one per kind per pass; lease: attempts+1, send_after +5 min
  sending --> sent: send() answered ok:true AND status 'sent' — sent_at set
  sending --> waiting: anything else (ok:false, other status, a throw) — last_error kept, send_after = +5 min, pushed past quiet hours
  sending --> given_up: 5th failed attempt — failed_at set, never tried again
  sent --> [*]
  given_up --> [*]
```

- `send()` is always passed in. The worker will pass notify-fanout's `send`
  (`src/ad-videos/notify-fanout.mjs`); tests pass a fake. UNVERIFIED: no worker yet (U22).
- Which events buzz (scripts ready, videos ready, stuck) is decided by the callers
  (U24, U35, M3). UNVERIFIED: none of them call `queueBuzz` yet.

### Model cost (marketing_model_usage, 411)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  C[a model call returns] --> L[logUsage: model = the model that SERVED it]
  L --> P{price known?<br/>MODEL_PRICES: claude-opus-5-5, claude-sonnet-5-5}
  P -->|yes| R1[cost_usd = tokens x price]
  P -->|no| R2[cost_usd NULL, never 0]
  R1 & R2 --> S[costStatus: batch total + this Arizona calendar month]
  S --> W[NULL rows counted at the highest known rate<br/>unpriced_rows reported]
  W --> K{at or over max_batch_cost_usd / max_month_cost_usd?<br/>missing cap = 40 / 300}
  K -->|yes| X[batch_capped / month_capped true]
  K -->|no| Y[keep writing]
```

UNVERIFIED: the writer that logs every call and stops at a cap is U24; Write now's refusal is U26.

### A shoot (marketing_shoots, 411)

Table only. States `planned | filming | uploaded | done`, enforced by the database; a done
shoot must have `finished_at`. Nothing reads or writes it yet (Shoot Day routes and screen
are later units). UNVERIFIED.

### Gaps between the spec and this code (findings, not reconciled)

- Spec §6 Step 3 lists `marketing_buzzes` without `attempts`, `last_error`, `failed_at`;
  the plan added them because notify-fanout's `send()` resolves `{ok:false}` instead of
  throwing. Built as the plan says.
- Spec §6 Step 4 says "After 3 attempts, a job fails". Here an attempt is a run that went
  wrong, not a claim, so wait loops (requeue) never use up tries.
- `group_key` is `NOT NULL DEFAULT ''` (spec lists it with no type) so "one waiting per
  group" also holds when no group is given.
